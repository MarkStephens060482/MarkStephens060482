As a cost for the accurate result, SON algorithm makes two passes of the whole dataset.This can be computationally achieveable by partitioning the dataset as a distributed file system and compute the A-priori algorithm in parallel on each partition.

The number of partitions is determined from ${1\\over p}$ where $p$ is the sample size proportion. For instance, the sample size of 10% would result in 10 partitions of the dataset. The *first_Mapper()* function is mapped across all partitions and then the reducer job adds up all the elements of the same key. The support count value is dropped and the remaining list of candidate frequent itemsets is materialised. The *second_Mapper()* function is mapped across all partitions, taking the list of candidate frequent itemsets as an argument. The candidate frequent itemsets and their support count are combined from all partitions. The frequent itemsets are determined from the candidates by filtering out those whom support count is greater than the minimum support threshold. The frequent itemsets are sorted in descending order of support count and materialised into a list.

        "The challenges in implementation of the above algorithms include having the support count in the outcome of the frequent itemsets for the Simple Randomised Apriori algorithm and failing to avoid the computationally expensive materialisation of RDDs for the SON algorithm. For the simple randomised algorithm, instances of the frequent itemsets identified from the sample were counted in the whole dataset in order to identify False Positives and have them removed from the list. In doing this, the support count was not included as the value together with the frequent itemset key in a key-value tuple pair element. This was due to Python Set datatype operations being employed to find the difference in sets of frequent itemsets from the sample and the whole dataset. The result of this led to the output list of frequent itemsets of different size not being sorted in ascending order by support count. The other challenge in implementation was for the SON algorithm with having to tolerate computationally expensive materialisation of RDDs for two occasions within the algorithm. The candidate frequent itemset RDD obtained from the first MapReduce job had to be materialised to a list inorder for instances of each candidate frequent itemset to be counted in each partition of the dataset. The second occasion of materialising an RDD was after the second MapReduce job to produce the output of the final frequent itemsets for the whole dataset.   \n"
